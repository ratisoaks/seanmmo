        <p>Haaa, xav the brown shade, :p </p>
        <p>My loving Benga</p>
        
        <p>This serves as an expression of Rati's love to you.</p>
        
        <p> Thank you for not ever ignoring the elephant in the room, lol. Bro I’m typing in nails, do you know how much that takes?

Anyway Chile,
            I’m grateful for you and I know it kind of seems like a reddish flag to thank someone for their selflessness, and maybe I shouldn’t have waited for Valentines to say this lol, but yea.
            I appreciate your selflessness towards the people you love and towards the relationship,  Please do note that she is grateful for the experiences you have granted her and shared with her. 
            She is grateful for all the growth that comes with the relationship.</p>

        
        <p>As you guys celebrate Valentine's Day together, 
        I want you to know that the love you have for her is heartwarming
         in ways you would never fathom. You can't fathom simply because 
         I can't put it in words or give you something to work with.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for being the most amazing partner anyone could ask for.
         I appreciate every memory we share and look forward to creating many more together.</p>
        
        <p>Happy Valentine's Day, my person. 
        May our bond be an EVER-evolving one and as it changes, I hope it stays nurturing as has been.</p>
        
        <p>Yours Truly,</p>
        <p>Now, I kinda lost track with the third person 
        speech and the me speech. So i don't know who i can say this letter is from.</p>
